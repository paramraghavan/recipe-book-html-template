<pre>
Sautee vegetables:
Cut half small onion into thin slices, 1/4 th  bell peppers in thin slices, one tomato in thin slices.
Spray little oil and keep it at 300 bake for 20 - 25 minutes, mix vegetables few times

Cucumber :
Cut 1/5th of the long cucumbers into thin slices. Get some lettuce leaf wash and shake away water 
Put the cucumber and lettuce above I  toaster for few minutes for the moisture to go away

Bread: 
Artisan wheat/grain/multi bread, sourdough bread. I would suggest something with bite and nutritional value 
like a whole wheat or multigrain bread with nuts and seeds for added crunch.

Toast the bread: 
Toast bread in a toaster or in the oven for 2-3 minutes on each side with the broil feature.

Chees Layer:
Add cheese layer on top of bread and toast it until the cheese melts. Let it cool. 
Put some pesto on one side and red pepper pesto on the other side of bread 

Apply some cream cheese, on top of pest layer , place cucumber, 
On apply some cream cheese to cucumber top and place lettuce
Do the above to both the sides of bread

Choose a bread side at atime:
  
Choose a bread side and place the saut√©ed vegetables. Sprinkle salt, pepper and Italian seasoning.
Now take the other bread side and place on top the bread you just seasoned 

Hold the bread together and wrap in parchment paper and slice it.
