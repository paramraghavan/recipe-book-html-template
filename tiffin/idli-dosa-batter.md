## Instructions:
  - Rinse and Soak:
    - Rinse the rice and urad dal separately until the water runs clear. Rinse and add the fenugreek seeds to the urad dal. Soak them in separate bowls with enough water for about 4-6 hours.

  - Fermentation:
    - Cover the bowl and leave it in a warm place to ferment. This process can take anywhere from 8 to 16 hours, depending on the climate. The batter should almost double in size and show tiny air bubbles.
  - Cooking:
    - Once fermented, stir the batter gently. Heat a non-stick skillet or a traditional dosa pan. Pour a ladleful of batter and spread it into a thin circle. Drizzle a bit of oil around the edges. Cook until the dosa is golden brown, then flip and cook the other side.

## Tips:
  - Consistency: The batter should be neither too thick nor too thin. Adjust with water if necessary.
  - Fermentation: In cooler climates, keeping the batter in an oven with the light on or in a pre-warmed (but turned off) oven can aid fermentation.
  - Storage: Unfermented batter can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. Ferment only the amount needed for immediate use.
