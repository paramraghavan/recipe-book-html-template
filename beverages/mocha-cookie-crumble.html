Mocha Cookie Crumble:
    Serving size - 2 people
    2 cups crushed ice
    1 cup milk
    90ml coffee decoction
    6 pumps dark chocolate syrup
    6 pumps vanilla syrup
    Crush 6 Oreos and put ⅔ of it into mixture
    Add all above to blender and blend it for about 40 seconds slowly going from 1 and going to 10 in about 15 seconds
    and keeping it at 10 for next 25 seconds

    Pour the above blend to a cup
    Top the cup with optional
      - whipped cream on
      - dark chocolate syrup
    And top it up with crushed Oreos from the remaining 1/3rd above.

    Note::
    Order in which you load your container is very important:
    The order in which you load your container is more important than you might realize. Always load liquids closest to
    the blades, then soft items, then hard or frozen items. Having the liquids on the bottom prevents air pockets from
    forming around the blades. And the weight of the frozen items on top helps to push the other ingredients into blades
    for a seamless blend. By loading your container in this order, you’ll prevent the blend from stalling or your
    machine from struggling with hard to blend items on the bottom.
