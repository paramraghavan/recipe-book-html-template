Ribbon Pakoda, also known as Ribbon Murukku, is a popular South Indian snack, especially during festivals like Diwali. It's crispy, savory, and quite simple to make. Here's a straightforward recipe:

### Ingredients:
- Gram flour (Besan) - 2 cups - sure crispy
  - or  Gram flour (Besan) - 3 cups, make sure to the thinnest disk to make it crispy
- Rice flour - 1 cup
- Butter or ghee - 2 tablespoons (melted)
- Cumin seeds or ajwain (carom seeds) - 1 teaspoon
- Asafoetida (hing) - 1/4 teaspoon or a pinch
- Red chili powder - 1 teaspoon (adjust to taste)
- Salt - to taste
- Water - as needed to make the dough
- Oil - for deep frying

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Dough**:
   - In a large bowl, mix together gram flour, rice flour, red chili powder, asafoetida, cumin seeds or ajwain, and salt.
   - Add the melted butter or ghee and mix well until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
   - Gradually add water and knead to form a smooth and soft dough. The dough should not be too stiff or too sticky.

2. **Heat the Oil**:
   - Heat oil in a deep frying pan. To test the oil, drop a small piece of dough into it. If it rises to the surface immediately without browning, the oil is ready.

3. **Shape and Fry the Pakodas**:
   - Fill the dough into a murukku press fitted with a ribbon pakoda disc (the one with multiple small slits).
   - Squeeze the press to drop strips of dough into the hot oil. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan.
   - Fry the pakodas on medium heat, turning them occasionally, until they turn golden brown and crispy.
   - Remove the pakodas with a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on kitchen paper.

4. **Cool and Store**:
   - Let the Ribbon Pakodas cool completely before storing them in an airtight container.

### Tips:
- The consistency of the dough is key. If it's too stiff, the pakodas will be hard. If it's too loose, they won't hold their shape.
- Adjust the spices according to your preference. You can also add sesame seeds for a different flavor.
- Ensure the oil is not too hot; otherwise, the pakodas will brown quickly without cooking properly inside.
